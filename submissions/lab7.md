## 7.2 Canary paused at 20%

I converted `k8s/gateway.yaml` from a Kubernetes `Deployment` to an Argo Rollouts `Rollout`. The gateway was configured with `replicas: 5` so that pod-based canary weights are easy to observe.

The canary strategy was configured as:

```text
20% -> manual pause -> 60% -> 30s pause -> 100%
```

After applying the updated manifest with `APP_VERSION=v2`, the Rollout stopped at the first canary pause:

```text
Phase:             Paused
Message:           CanaryPauseStep
Current Step Index: 1
Stable Rs:         66f7cd456b
Updated Replicas:  1
```

ReplicaSet split at this point:

```text
replicaset.apps/gateway-58b8f8d974   DESIRED=1   READY=1   app_version=v2
replicaset.apps/gateway-66f7cd456b   DESIRED=4   READY=4   stable
```

This matches the expected 20% canary split with 5 replicas: 1 updated canary pod and 4 stable pods.

---

## 7.3 Traffic split verification

To verify the traffic distribution, I used the in-cluster load generator instead of `kubectl port-forward`. This is important because port-forwarding can stick to a single endpoint, while an in-cluster client sends traffic through the Kubernetes Service and kube-proxy.

I counted `/events` requests from gateway pod logs:

```text
pod/gateway-58b8f8d974-jl6bw hash=58b8f8d974 app_version=v2 events_requests=80
pod/gateway-66f7cd456b-4586g hash=66f7cd456b app_version=stable events_requests=61
pod/gateway-66f7cd456b-l4lmk hash=66f7cd456b app_version=stable events_requests=89
pod/gateway-66f7cd456b-w4zn7 hash=66f7cd456b app_version=stable events_requests=80
pod/gateway-66f7cd456b-wcf77 hash=66f7cd456b app_version=stable events_requests=90
```

Total requests:

```text
canary_requests = 80
total_requests  = 400
canary_share    = 80 / 400 = 20%
```

The canary received exactly 20% of requests in this sample, which matches the configured `setWeight: 20`.

## 7.4 Promote to 100%

The plugin was installed after the first paused capture. For that reason, I used the same status-level effect that `kubectl argo rollouts promote gateway` performs for clearing the pause condition:

```bash
kubectl patch rollout gateway --type=merge --subresource=status -p '{"status":{"pauseConditions":null}}'
```

The equivalent normal command after installing the plugin is:

```bash
kubectl argo rollouts promote gateway
```

Intermediate state after promotion to the next step:

```text
Current Step Index: 2
Updated Replicas:  3
Stable Rs:         66f7cd456b
Message:           more replicas need to be updated
```

Final state after the rollout reached 100%:

```text
Status:          Healthy
Step:            5/5
SetWeight:       100
ActualWeight:    100
Desired:         5
Updated:         5
Ready:           5
Available:       5
Stable RS:       58b8f8d974
```

At this point, the new `v2` ReplicaSet became the stable ReplicaSet.

---

## 7.5 Abort bad version

Next, I changed the candidate version to `APP_VERSION=v3-bad` and applied the manifest. The Rollout again paused at the 20% canary step:

```text
Phase:             Paused
Message:           CanaryPauseStep
Stable Rs:         58b8f8d974
Current Pod Hash:  6b5c59dfd5
Updated Replicas:  1
```

ReplicaSet split before abort:

```text
replicaset.apps/gateway-58b8f8d974   DESIRED=4   READY=4   stable
replicaset.apps/gateway-6b5c59dfd5   DESIRED=1   READY=1   v3-bad
```

The normal command for aborting the rollout is:

```bash
kubectl argo rollouts abort gateway
```

Since I was preserving the same capture flow, I used the equivalent status patch:

```bash
kubectl patch rollout gateway --type=merge --subresource=status -p '{"status":{"abort":true}}'
```

Measured rollback timing:

```text
elapsed_ms=284 stable_replicas=4 bad_replicas=1
elapsed_ms=1467 stable_replicas=5 bad_replicas=0
```

Output after abort:

```text
Phase:     Degraded
Message:   RolloutAborted: Rollout aborted update to revision 3
Stable RS: 58b8f8d974

replicaset.apps/gateway-58b8f8d974   DESIRED=5   READY=5
replicaset.apps/gateway-6b5c59dfd5   DESIRED=0   READY=0
```

After verifying the abort behavior, I restored the desired manifest back to `APP_VERSION=v2` so that Git does not keep the intentionally bad version as the desired state.

---

## 7.6 Rollback comparison

Argo Rollouts abort moved all Service traffic back to the stable ReplicaSet in about **1.5 seconds**. The bad canary ReplicaSet was scaled down, and the stable ReplicaSet returned to 5 ready replicas almost immediately.

This is much faster than the Lab 5 Git revert rollback path. A Git revert rollback requires a revert commit, push, CI or image/manifest update, and ArgoCD sync before the cluster converges. In contrast, Argo Rollouts abort is an in-cluster control-plane operation. It avoids the Git/CI polling loop during an active bad canary and limits the blast radius while the rollout is still in progress.

# Task 2 — Multi-step canary with observation

## 7.7 Multi-step canary strategy

I updated the Rollout strategy to use a more granular canary rollout. I also kept an automated analysis step after the first observation window.

```yaml
strategy:
  canary:
    steps:
      - setWeight: 20
      - pause:
          duration: 60s
      - analysis:
          templates:
            - templateName: gateway-error-rate
          args:
            - name: canary-hash
              valueFrom:
                podTemplateHashValue: Latest
      - setWeight: 40
      - pause:
          duration: 60s
      - setWeight: 60
      - pause:
          duration: 60s
      - setWeight: 80
      - pause:
          duration: 30s
      - setWeight: 100
```

The rollout increases the canary gradually from 20% to 40%, 60%, 80%, and finally 100%. This gives time to observe the candidate version before sending all traffic to it.

---

## 7.8 Observed rollout steps

Observed state at the 20% step:

```text
Step:          1/10
SetWeight:     20
ActualWeight:  20
Updated:       1
Ready:         5
```

Observed state after the analysis step and promotion to 40%:

```text
Step:          4/10
SetWeight:     40
ActualWeight:  40
Updated:       2
AnalysisRun:   gateway-56d9cbd5c9-6-2 Successful
```

Observed state at the 60% step:

```text
Step:          6/10
SetWeight:     60
ActualWeight:  60
Updated:       3
Ready:         5
```

Final state after full promotion:

```text
Step:            10/10
SetWeight:       100
ActualWeight:    100
Updated:         5
Ready:           5
Status:          Healthy
```

## 7.9 Observation during the rollout

Because the Lab 3 host Prometheus/Grafana stack cannot directly scrape k3d pod IPs, I used `kubectl argo rollouts get rollout gateway --watch` together with the in-cluster load generator to observe the rollout behavior.

During the rollout, request traffic stayed steady while the number of updated replicas increased step by step:

```text
1 updated replica  -> 20%
2 updated replicas -> 40%
3 updated replicas -> 60%
5 updated replicas -> 100%
```

This matched the configured canary weights and confirmed that the Rollout was progressing gradually instead of replacing all pods at once.

I would want an automated abort at **20%** if there is a clear increase in 5xx errors. At that point, one canary pod is already receiving real user traffic, which is enough to detect a broken dependency or bad release behavior. At the same time, the blast radius is limited to about one fifth of total traffic.
