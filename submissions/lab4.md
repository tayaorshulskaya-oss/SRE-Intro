# Lab 4 — Kubernetes: Deploy QuickTicket to a Cluster

**Student:** Rolan  
**Branch:** `feature/lab4`  
**Date:** 2026-06-18

---

## Task 1 — Write Manifests & Deploy to k3d (6 pts)

### 4.1 — k3d cluster created (`kubectl get nodes`)

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ k3d cluster create quickticket
INFO[0089] Cluster 'quickticket' created successfully!
INFO[0089] You can now use it like this:
kubectl cluster-info

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
k3d-quickticket-server-0   Ready    control-plane   13s   v1.35.5+k3s1
```

One node, status `Ready`.

### 4.2 — Images built and imported into k3d

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:app rolanmulukin$ docker build -t quickticket-gateway:v1 ./gateway
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:app rolanmulukin$ docker build -t quickticket-events:v1 ./events
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:app rolanmulukin$ docker build -t quickticket-payments:v1 ./payments

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:app rolanmulukin$ k3d image import quickticket-gateway:v1 quickticket-events:v1 quickticket-payments:v1 -c quickticket
INFO[0000] Importing image(s) into cluster 'quickticket'

quickticket-payments   v1   22b82b64039f   16 hours ago   237MB
```

### 4.3–4.4 — Manifests written and applied

I wrote one Deployment + Service per component from scratch
(`postgres`, `redis`, `events`, `payments`, `gateway`) — the full manifests are in the
**Appendix** at the end of this report.
All app Deployments use `imagePullPolicy: Never` so K8s uses the locally imported images.
Service names (`postgres`, `redis`, `events`, `payments`, `gateway`) double as in-cluster DNS hostnames,
which is how the env vars wire the services together (e.g. `DB_HOST=postgres`, `EVENTS_URL=http://events:8081`).

```text

deployment.apps/gateway created
service/gateway created
deployment.apps/events created

```

### 4.5 — Database seeded

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl exec -i $(kubectl get pod -l app=postgres -o name) -- \
>   psql -U quickticket -d quickticket -f /dev/stdin < app/seed.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 5
```

### 4.6 — All pods & services running (`kubectl get pods,svc`)

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl get pods,svc
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Full stack working via port-forward (`curl localhost:3080/events`)

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl port-forward svc/gateway 3080:8080 &
[1] 41872
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3080 -> 8080

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ curl -s http://localhost:3080/events | python3 -m json.tool
[
    {
        "id": 1,

]

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ curl -s http://localhost:3080/health | python3 -m json.tool
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "checks": {
        "events": "ok",
        "payments": "ok",
        "circuit_payments": "CLOSED"
    }
}
```

The full critical path resolves end-to-end: `curl → gateway → events → postgres/redis`, with the seeded
5 events returned and `/health` reporting all downstream dependencies `ok`.

### 4.7 — Self-healing (`kubectl get pods -w` during pod deletion)

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl get pods -l app=gateway -w &
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl delete pod -l app=gateway
pod "gateway-7cd55d8774-29hzl" deleted

NAME                       READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
gateway-7cd55d8774-29hzl   1/1     Running             0          36s
gateway-7cd55d8774-29hzl   1/1     Terminating         0          38s
gateway-7cd55d8774-29hzl   0/1     Completed           0          39s
gateway-7cd55d8774-fm5dl   0/1     Pending             0          0s
gateway-7cd55d8774-fm5dl   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
gateway-7cd55d8774-fm5dl   0/1     Running             0          0s
gateway-7cd55d8774-fm5dl   1/1     Running             0          6s
```

The instant the old pod (`...29hzl`) terminated, the Deployment's ReplicaSet created a
replacement (`...fm5dl`) — `Pending → ContainerCreating → Running` — and it became `1/1 Ready`
about **6 s** after creation (total end-to-end recovery measured at **~8 s**).

### Answer — K8s recovery vs docker-compose

> K8s recreated the deleted pod **automatically in ~8 seconds**, with **no manual intervention**.
> The Deployment controller continuously reconciles desired state (`replicas: 1`) against actual
> state; deleting the pod drops the count to 0, so the ReplicaSet immediately schedules a new one.
> In Lab 1 with docker-compose, a stopped container **stays down** until I run `docker compose start`
> (or `restart`) by hand — Compose has no reconciliation loop, it only acts on explicit commands.
> This is the core difference: K8s gives **declarative self-healing**, Compose is **imperative**.

## Task 2 — Probes & Resource Limits (4 pts)

### 4.9 — Probes configured (`kubectl describe pod`)

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl describe pod -l app=gateway | grep -E "Liveness|Readiness"
    Liveness:   http-get http://:8080/health delay=10s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
    Readiness:  http-get http://:8080/health delay=0s timeout=1s period=5s #success=1 #failure=2

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl describe pod -l app=events | grep -E "Liveness|Readiness"
    Liveness:   http-get http://:8081/health delay=10s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
    Readiness:  http-get http://:8081/health delay=0s timeout=1s period=5s #success=1 #failure=2
```

Liveness and readiness HTTP probes against `/health` are configured on `gateway` (8080),
`events` (8081) and `payments` (8082).

### 4.10 — Readiness failure during Redis deletion

I deleted the Redis pod and sampled the `events` pod's READY column once per second.
`events`/`health` returns 503 when Redis is unreachable, so its readiness probe starts failing:

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl delete pod -l app=redis
pod "redis-65bb44458c-r56qv" deleted

# events pod sampled every 1s (time | name | READY | STATUS | RESTARTS):
12:04:47  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   1/1   Running   0
12:04:48  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   1/1   Running   0
12:04:49  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   0/1   Running   0   <-- readiness fails, removed from Service endpoints
12:04:50  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   0/1   Running   0
12:04:52  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   0/1   Running   0
12:04:53  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   0/1   Running   0
12:04:54  events-78696fcf65-6jxv7   1/1   Running   0   <-- Redis recreated, probe passes again
```

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl describe pod -l app=events | grep -A1 "Readiness probe failed"
  Warning  Unhealthy  62s (x2 over 67s)  kubelet  Readiness probe failed: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
  Warning  Unhealthy  62s                kubelet  Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
  Warning  Unhealthy  60s                kubelet  Liveness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
```

The `events` pod went **`0/1 Ready`** for ~5 s — K8s removed it from the Service endpoints so no
traffic was routed to it — but **`RESTARTS` stayed `0`**: the pod was *not* killed. K8s self-healing
recreated the deleted Redis pod within a few seconds, the readiness probe passed again, and `events`
returned to `1/1 Ready`. Note the liveness probe logged a single 503 too, but it needs 3 consecutive
failures (30 s) to restart — Redis recovered long before that, so no restart happened.

### 4.11 — Resource limits + node allocation

Every container declares `requests` (cpu 50m / mem 64Mi) and `limits` (cpu 200m / mem 256Mi).

```text
MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl describe node $(kubectl get nodes -o name | head -1) | grep -A 9 "Allocated resources"
Allocated resources:
  (Total limits may be over 100 percent, i.e., overcommitted.)
  Resource           Requests     Limits
  --------           --------     ------
  cpu                450m (22%)   1 (50%)
  memory             460Mi (23%)  1450Mi (73%)
  ephemeral-storage  0 (0%)       0 (0%)
  hugepages-1Gi      0 (0%)       0 (0%)
  hugepages-2Mi      0 (0%)       0 (0%)

MacBook-Pro-pon4ik:SRE-Intro rolanmulukin$ kubectl top pods
NAME                        CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)
events-78696fcf65-6jxv7     5m           42Mi
gateway-7cd55d8774-fm5dl    6m           38Mi
payments-d7dc94485-zq6xn    5m           41Mi
postgres-76cd478b6b-582cz   4m           30Mi
redis-65bb44458c-5n2bx      9m           8Mi
```

Five app pods × 50m requested = 250m, plus k3d system pods (CoreDNS, traefik, metrics-server, etc.)
bring the node to 450m CPU / 460Mi memory requested. Actual usage (`kubectl top`) is far below the
requests — the requests are reservations for the scheduler, not live consumption.

### Answer — liveness vs readiness for DB connectivity

> **Readiness probe failure** = the pod is removed from the Service endpoints (no traffic routed to it),
> but the pod is **not** restarted. **Liveness probe failure** = the pod is considered dead and is
> **killed and restarted**.
>
> For **database connectivity** you should use a **readiness** probe, not liveness. If the DB is down,
> restarting the app pod does nothing to fix the DB — it just churns pods (and can cause a
> `CrashLoopBackOff` storm across every replica at once). With readiness, the pod stays alive but is
> pulled out of rotation until the DB comes back, then automatically rejoins. Use **liveness** only for
> *self*-faults the process can fix by restarting (deadlock, wedged event loop), never for a shared
> external dependency.

## Bonus Task — Helm Chart (2 pts)

I converted the raw manifests into a Helm chart under `k8s/chart/` (templates parameterised via
`{{ .Values.* }}`, including a shared `resources` block injected with `toYaml`).

### `Chart.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v2

```

### `values.yaml`

```yaml

After re-seeding the fresh Helm-managed postgres pod, the full stack works through the Helm release
exactly as with the raw manifests (`/health` → all `ok`).

**Monitoring (`kube-prometheus-stack`):** optional sub-step, not installed in this run — I focused
the bonus on converting QuickTicket itself into a working, lint-clean Helm chart.
